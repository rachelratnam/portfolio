    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p1>Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Rachel Ratnam and I am a junior at Saint Francis High School. I am 15 years old and am very passionate about coding! I am currently attending the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program at Adobe headquarters in San Jose. I have taken classes in programming, have attended the GWC club at my local library. I have also created a GWC club at my school to encourage girls to take on the field of computer programming and close the gender gap! I have also attended multiple hackathons where I did projects like programming websites to raise peoples' awareness of their <a href="https://constitutionwethepeople.wordpress.com/">constitutional rights</a> and develop app outlines to provide women with job opportunities according to their preferences. Not only do I focus on programming but I have been playing volleyball for over 7 years and currently play for Vision Volleyball Club as a middle hitter and blocker. On my profile page you will find your likes and dislikes, a funfact about myself, and some of my favorite webpages. Enjoy!</p1>
