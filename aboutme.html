    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p1>Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Rachel Ratnam and I am a junior at Saint Francis High School. I am 15 years old and am very passionate about coding! I am currently attending the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program at Adobe headquarters in San Jose. I have taken classes in programming, have attended the GWC club at my local library. I have also created a GWC club at my school to encourage girls to take on the field of computer programming and close the gender gap! I have also attended multiple hackathons where I did projects like programming websites to raise peoples' awareness of their <a href="https://constitutionwethepeople.wordpress.com/">constitutional rights</a> and develop app outlines to provide women with job opportunities according to their preferences. Not only do I focus on programming but I have been playing volleyball for over 7 years and currently play for Vision Volleyball Club as a middle hitter and blocker. On my profile page you will find your likes and dislikes, a funfact about myself, and some of my favorite webpages. Enjoy!</p1>

    <h3>Reflection from GWC </h3>
    <p3> Today we learned python and it was a really fun experience. Yesterday we learned HTML when we programmed this website but today I learned a language I have never learnt before. I liked how I could apply the functions and basic rules I learned into this. I learnt about data types, conditioanls, ranges, booleans, and more. It was very interesting and I really enjoyed it. It was cool to see the answers come out when inputting a problem or question. Not only that, but we had a guest lecturer from Adobe photoshop. She is the program manager and she taught us how to use photohop and gave us access to photoshop for a full year. My partner and I photoshopped a picture of me onto the mvoie poster of Mean Girls in place of one of the girls. It was really fun to experiment with this new software that I have never used before and I like learning more about it including tools like the snipping tool, cropping, content overload, and more! I would love to use photoshop again! 
      <p4>Today we did a project to practice and demonstrate the skills that we learned during yesterdays python session. My partner a I coded the program to draw shapes, we made function, and we made a really complicated tessellation. There were many bugs in the tessellation because we let the user input how many sides they want, what color they want, and how many tesselation they want which all accumulated as a big problem because it was pretty hard to figure out how the sides and the amount of tesselation could correspond, and how much the sides had to increase every single time since they differed for the different amount of sides. However, after lots and lots and lots of trial and error, my partner and I finally figure out how to debug it and we are very proud of our creation. We also began to create the girls who code logo which was also pretty hard, but we did not get enough time to finish it.
